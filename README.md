# Projected Coloring Illustration

This is a repository for the software that was developed to support an interactive experience in which visitors can paint and rearrange different components of an illustration projected on the walls of a room. [openFrameworks](https://openframeworks.cc/) to generate the final application, and addons such as [ofxLeapMotion2](https://github.com/genekogan/ofxLeapMotion2) and [ofxPiMapper](https://ofxpimapper.com/) were used in order to provide support for a LeapMotion controller and projection mapping.
